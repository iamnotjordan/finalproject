# Hotel of Fear (Final Project)

## The Beginnings and Challenges

The first draft of the game idea was to create a Horror game that had tasks for the player to do in order to escape. But I ended up not completing that, instead I stayed with the Horror game idea and made a game where the player starts off in a room and tries to escape a creepy hotel that ends up becoming a maze with a twist. I added in many horror aspects you would usually see in other horror games such as jumpscares, weird noises, dark hallways, etc. 

During my project I've encountered many problems, since I was very new to coding in LUA I had to set myself down to try and understand the basics of certain aspects by watching tutorials and reading forums which was very helpful. I believe the hardest code in this project was the MonsterNPC that chases the player around and tries to kill them. After a lot of research and looking around I only coded a basic CPU that would track down the nearest player from a certain distance. But I also found out that there's such thing as a CPU pathfinding which was definitely out of my comfort zone. Something I wish I could've done instead with the CPU Monster is create it to walk certain paths all around the map and when the Monster is within the distance that it's set to track the player's torso it would chase them for a certain amount of time till the player outruns it.

There were a couple of things that were created by other people that I used and incorporated it into my game. I used an Animation script that was in the ROBLOX Studio Store that basically animated the MonsterNPC to have more realistic movements rather than linear movements. I used these animations instead because I don't really know how to animate each bit and pieces just yet and it seems like most animations are recommended to use Blender which is a bit more sophisitcated. Like I mentioned before though I did script the MonsterNPC to track the players down by it's distance/radius of the nearest player. I also used Crygen54's Sprinting and Stamina script which was on the devForum which he shared to other users for them to use: https://devforum.roblox.com/t/sprint-stamina-system-gui-bar/1215024 

## The Enjoyments of My Adventures

Somethings I really enjoyed coding was the smaller things such as opening/closing the door, animating jumpscares to my experience, creating a death screen GUI that pops up a countdown when you will respawn and just building in general. Something that I also learned from using the ROBLOX Studio client is they have set Storages for different aspects such as GUI's, ServerScriptStorage, ReplicatedStorage, etc. and there was also a LocalScript and a Script. The LocalScript is client-sided and the Script is server-sided. The building aspect of my project was also really fun, but it does take planning because you want a good layout and lighting that gives the game the effect you want on players. For example, in my game I made it so it's very dim and dark and added a sort of white noise that gives the game a little fear factor. Adding in sound/music makes the game have a better horror environment rather than it being just silent. I do think I could've made the map a bit better but I wanted to get something simple out for the map and move onto other major aspects.

I decided using ROBLOX to create my game because all my life I've played ROBLOX so I took this chance to actually create something to hopefully create something even better in the future. I used this project as a stepping stone to motivate me in creating other games. I do believe I could have finished this game if I were given more time or if I worked with more people. I had many ideas for this project but I just didn't know how I could execute it or where to start from because there was just so many things I planned on doing and it ended up being a mess.
