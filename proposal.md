# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?



## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A ROBLOX horror game where the player has to complete multiple tasks in order to escape. With a twist that there is a monster that chases you as you complete these tasks.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

I will be using ROBLOX Studio software, it will have all kinds of features such as building, scripting, GUI, etc.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A completed game: all minigames the user has to complete to escape will be completed and a monster that chases you around.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

To have a better outcome I'm hoping I'll have time to add lots of jumpscares and create good audio to add the affect of the fear of playing.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

For the best outcome I'm hoping to have enough time to create nice buildings and interior of the game where it's pleasing to the eye. Making it nice but very scary at the same time. I'm hoping to give it that horror vibe that you see in other videogames and movies. I also hope I can create a starting lobby where players can sit at and join the game when they please. For the best experience, in the future I'll add little things such as shops and perks for the user to purchase so that they can use it for their advantange in the game.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

From now till the due date of the project I will have to research more into the languages ROBLOX uses in order to create this game. I'm most certain ROBLOX uses LUA so it will be an experience to learn as time goes on. I already have some experience in using ROBLOX building mechanics but hopefully I'll continue to learn more about other different mechanics it also has to offer. I'm most excited in creating the UI for the player to interact with such as to start the game and game menu.
